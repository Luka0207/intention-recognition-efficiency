- **models/**: Implementation of LSTM, Transformer, and Hybrid models.
- **evaluation/**: Scripts for evaluating models and benchmarking on the OAK-D system.
- **multimodal_integration/**: Code for combining skeletal data with other modalities.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualizations.
- **scripts/**: Preprocessing and utility scripts.
- **results/**: Logs, plots, and results of the experiments.
- **docs/**: Project documentation.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
